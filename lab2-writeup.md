## Question 1 - Grammars: Synthetic Examples

### (a) Describe the language defined by the following grammar:
		S ::= ABA
		A ::= a|aA
		B ::= epsilon|bBc|BB 

### (b) Consider the following grammar:
		S ::= AaBb
		A ::= Ab|b
		B ::= aB|a
Which of the following sentences are in the language generated by this grammar? For the sentences that are described by this grammar, demonstrate that they are by giving **derivations**. 

		1.baab
		2.bbbab
		3.bbaaaaa
		4.bbaab

### (c) Consider the following grammar:
		S ::= aScB|A|b
		A ::= cA|c
		B ::= d|A
Which of the following sentences are in the language generated by this grammar? For the sentences that are described by this grammar, demonstrate that they are by giving **parse trees**.

		1.abcd
		2.acccbd
		3.acccbcc
		4.acd
		5.accc

### (d)Consider the following grammar:
		A ::= a|b|A+A
Show that this grammar is ambiguous.

### (e) Let us ascribe a semantics to the syntactic objects A specified in the above grammar from part d. In particular, let us write
		Aâ‡“n
for the judgment form that should mean A has a total n a symbols where n is the meta- variable for natural numbers. Define this judgment form via a set of inference rules. You may rely upon arithmetic operators over natural numbers. Hint: There should be one inference rule for each production of the non-terminal A (called a syntax-directed judgment form).


## Question 2 - Grammars: Understanding a Language
In the following, I have left off the return type of function g.The body of g is well-typed if we can come up with a valid return type. 


Is the body of g well-typed?

If so, give the return type of g and explain how you determined this type.

	The body of g is well typed, because it returns a tuple of type ((Int, Int), Int). 
		a = Int
		b = Tuple (Int, Int)

		val(a,b): (Int, (Int,Int)) because
			a = 1: Int
			b = (x,3): tuple (Int, Int) because
				input x: Int
				3: int
