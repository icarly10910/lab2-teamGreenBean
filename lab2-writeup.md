# Lab 1 Writeup: Arthi Kumar and Carly Romig

## Question 1 - Grammars: Synthetic Examples

### (a) Describe the language defined by the following grammar:
		S ::= ABA
		A ::= a|aA
		B ::= epsilon|bBc|BB 

### (b) Consider the following grammar:
		S ::= AaBb
		A ::= Ab|b
		B ::= aB|a
Which of the following sentences are in the language generated by this grammar? For the sentences that are described by this grammar, demonstrate that they are by giving derivations. 


## Question 2: Typing
In the following, I have left off the return type of function g.The body of g is well-typed if we can come up with a valid return type.

Is the body of g well-typed?

If so, give the return type of g and explain how you determined this type.

	The body of g is well typed, because it returns a tuple of type ((Int, Int), Int). 
		a = Int
		b = Tuple (Int, Int)

		val(a,b): (Int, (Int,Int)) because
			a = 1: Int
			b = (x,3): tuple (Int, Int) because
				input x: Int
				3: int
